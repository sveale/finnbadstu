# AI Setup Files

This repository includes baseline setup for Codex and Claude Code.

## Files
- `AGENTS.md`: Primary agent instructions (Codex-friendly).
- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude Code-specific operating instructions.
- `AI_CONTEXT.md`: Shared project facts and commands used by all agents.
- `.claude/commands/plan.md`: Reusable planning command prompt.
- `.claude/commands/review.md`: Reusable review command prompt.

## Suggested Maintenance Rule
- Update `AI_CONTEXT.md` first when project details change.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` aligned with those details.
